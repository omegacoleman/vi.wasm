# vi.wasm

[Try it now!](https://vi.yccb.me/)

A fork of [vis](https://github.com/martanne/vis) stripped down to the core, compiled to wasm, and running on a webpage.

Files under libc are taken from [newlib](https://sourceware.org/newlib/)

Needs clang17 to compile.

## TODO

- support saving and loading files
